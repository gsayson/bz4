                    I&apos;m a full-stack developer who likes to dabble in everything, from web development with <a href="https://react.dev" className="link">React</a> and <a href="https://www.solidjs.com" className="link">SolidJS</a> to compilers and OS development.
                    In addition, I also work with <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/" className="link">Java</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" className="link">Rust</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started programming when I was 7 years old, beginning with the language of <a href="https://www.lua.org" className="link">Lua</a>. At that time I wanted to make scripts in <em>ROBLOX</em>.
                    A few months later I wrote stuff in Python, especially using Django and Flask; then I wanted to try and make a <em>Minecraft</em> client, so I tried to learn Java (successfully) and
                    eventually I got to learn how to use Spring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I write programs in Java, Rust, and Python (if <em>absolutely</em> necessary), along with frontends using React or SolidJS (in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" className="link">TypeScript</a>).
